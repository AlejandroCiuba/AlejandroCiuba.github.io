                        <h4>Essay Evaluation Baseline</h4>
                        <p>I trained several baseline BERT models for an AAAI iRAISE workshop paper in collaboration with Joey Hou and Dr. Lorraine Li. The models were trained to score essays given a particular prompt and criteria. I utilized starter code provided by the authors of the original paper. However, the starter code required extensive modification to make testable, including making a training pipeline, implementing their described custom loss function, and training the model for all essay prompts (as their example model was only trained for one of the dataset's prompts). Our <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v273/hou25a.html.">paper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JoeyHou/essay_eval">code</a> are publically available.</p>

                        <h4>ELAN Data</h4>
                        <p>A custom built API designed to create and work with ELAN files (.eaf extension) in Python. This library is open-source, and anyone can work on or contribute to it. <a href="https://github.com/AlejandroCiuba/elan_data" style="text-decoration: underline;">Link.</a></p>

                        <h4>APLS Automatic Speech Segmentation Pipeline</h4>
                        <p>I utilized a finetuned pyannote model and custom built API to create ELAN transcriptions which were pre-segmented between speakers and phrases. Work is private and for the APLS lab. <a href="alejandrociuba@pitt.edu">Email me</a> for more information.</p>

                                    <p>I made during the first Pitt Computer Science Club Hackathon. I won best overall project and best beginner project. It took about 6 weeks of work. I programmed everything in Unity, and made the assets, UI, and music myself. I was inspired by the original novel <i>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions</i> by Edwin Abbott Abbott.</p>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, the main game is lost on some hard drive. And the existing demo is Windows only. I don't remember what version of Unity I used. Assets and UI were made in Aseprite and the music/sound effects were made in LMMS.</p>
