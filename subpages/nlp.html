        <h1>My Journey into Natural-Language Processing</h1>
        <h2>My Start</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I completed <a href="https://sites.pitt.edu/~naraehan/ling1330/" target="_blank">Introduction to Computational Linguistics</a> taught by Dr. Na-Rae Han in the Fall 2021 Semester. All code has been published to a private
        repository. Any and all access to said repository must be asked for explicitly and is strictly confidential. However, the second course in the series, 
        <a href="https://naraehan.github.io/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/" target="_blank">Data Science for Linguists</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022" target="_blank">public organization</a>. There, you can see my term project
    <a href="https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2022/Sociolinguistics-In-Video-Games" target="_blank">Pragmatics in Video Games</a>. Additionally, I have done 
        research with Dr. Alan Juffs and Dr. Na-Rae Han, helping to organize their speech data for the <a href="https://eli-data-mining-group.github.io/Pitt-ELI-Corpus/" target="_blank">PELIC Corpus</a>.</p>
        <h2>Where I am now</h2>
        <p>I worked with a team of researchers during my time at the 8th annual Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop at Johns Hopkins University developing a translation model
        for the under-resourced langauges, Tamasheq. I am currently serving as an undergraduate research assistant to Dr. Dan Villarreal and Dr. Scott Kiesling, helping
        improve their current ASR pipeline for their APLS LaBB-CAT project. My current interests are: improving/creating systems for under-resourced languages 
        , working with code-switched speech, and potentially exploring multi-modal models such as speech+text or text+image.</p>
        <h2>My (Hopeful) Future</h2>
        <p>If you've come this far, thank you for reading all of this! As for my future prospects, I have currently applied to several PhD and Master's programs
        hoping to continue my NLP journey. My ultimate goal is to become an academic scholar and researcher.</p>
